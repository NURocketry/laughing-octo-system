# Summer Project 2020 - Software project - Live data handling

## Quick Start: Running locally
1. Open liveData.html in Chromium 
2. Run server.py 
3. Refresh the page. At present a couple refreshes might be needed


## TODO
* Get working on Windows
* Have labels on the access
* Build local web server
* Elegant way to implement numeric data in liveData.html
* OBS Feed
* Write data to file
* Ability to review written data
* Robust error handeling in server.py i.e. Must always send a valid string
